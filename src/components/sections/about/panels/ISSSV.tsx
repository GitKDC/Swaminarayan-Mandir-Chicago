                For the salvation of all souls and to. establish a lineage of pure form of worship, Shree Swaminarayan
                Bhagwan committed to one resolution:
            </p>

            <p>
                “I will build temples and install deities. Anyone who oƯers worship to the deities while following moral
                principles, he/she will attain the four aims of human life namely: Dharma (righteousness, moral values),
                Artha (prosperity, economic values), Kama (pleasure, love, psychological values), and Moksha (liberation,
                spiritual values). There is no better achiever than the one who performs temple services (temple seva),
                serves liberated saints, and oƯers devotion to God with reverence.”
            </p>

            <p className="italic text-center">
                ~~ Satsangi Jivan, Prakran 4, Part 24, Shlok 10-11 ~~
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, Nishkulanand Swami emphasizes the superiority of service to temples and described by
                Shreeji Maharaj:
            </p>

            <p className="italic text-center">
                “The result is attainment of Akshardham, where one can be fulfilled”
            </p>
            <p className="italic text-center">
                “These are the words of Shreeji Maharaj Himself and I have heard them firsthand”
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, Nishkulanand Swami asserts the greatness of the deities:
                “Shreeji Maharaj stated that millions will achieve liberation through (with the help of) the deities. Relying
                on murti of salvation is the best means for salvation.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Shree Swaminarayan Bhagwan makes his wishes clearly known toward all the followers of the Sampradaya
                (Holy Fellowship) in the Shakshapatri Shrok 62:
                “All shall worship with singular devotion only that form of Lord Shri Krishna which is installed by the
                Acharya (who is a descendant of the family of Shri Dharmadev) and assigned to them for the purpose by
                him. All other forms of Lord Shri Krishna shall but be bowed and respected.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The Deities of all ISSSV Temples were installed or blessed by the Acharya Maharajshrees of Vadtal Gaadi
                (the South Diocese of the Sampradaya)
